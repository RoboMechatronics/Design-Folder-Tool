# Design-Folder-Tool
This app is used to create/find/open folder for projects.
Device folder format is like XXX-YYYYYY in Part Number textbox.
ECO textbox is a series number like 012345 created automatically by a portal application of your company.
The link above large textbox is parent folder which you used to store design folder. You can change it in paths.txt.

You create a folder template which its name/path is similar in paths.txt and run this app. Let's see result.

This app was packaged by PyInstaller.

Let's make sure paths in paths.txt file is existed before run to avoid crash.

Gookluck!
